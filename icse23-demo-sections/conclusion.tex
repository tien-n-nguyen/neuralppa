\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We introduce a neural network-based program dependence analysis tool, \tool, which extends the construction of CFG/PDGs to partial code snippets. Owing to the significant speed markup ($\sim$380$\times$), we envision an opportunity for the integration of such a tool in the software development process, which will help facilitate real-time program analysis. Our tool can also benefit SE tasks such as vulnerability detection (VD), code completion, fault localization, etc., that can tolerate low levels of inaccuracies. The current prototype is highly accurate and supports Java and C/C++ at this point -- we plan to conquer other programming languages as well. In the future, we seek to combine our tool with existing PA tools, while also exploring cross-segment dependency-capturing strategies, so as to make it robust across larger codebases.
