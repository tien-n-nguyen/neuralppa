We show how UMLcan be used to specify information related to access control in the overall design of an application and how this information can be used to automatically generate complete access control infrastructures. Our approach can be used to improve productivity during the development of secure distributed systems and the quality of the resulting systems.},

This book presents the extension UMLsec of the Unified Modeling Language for secure systems development. The book is written in a way which keeps the first part (ch 1-5), describing UMLsec and ist use, accessible to anyone with an interest in computer security and a basic background on object-oriented systems. It can also be used as part of a general course on applying UML or on computer security. The second part (ch 6-9) is about the mathematical tools needed to use the UMLsec approach to verify UML specifications against security requirements and assumes some familarity with precise methods of system development. A practically relevant example is used throughout the book to demonstrate the presented methods.}

abstract="With the rise of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) as a software development methodology, which increases productivity and, supported by powerful code generation tools, allows a less error-prone implementation process, the idea of modeling security aspects during the design phase of the software development process was first suggested by the research community almost a decade ago. While various approaches for Model Driven Security (MDS) have been proposed during the years, it is still unclear, how these concepts compare to each other and whether they can improve the security of software projects. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of current MDS approaches based on a simple web application scenario and discuss the strengths and limitations of the various techniques, as well as the practicability of MDS for web application security in general.",

pages="213--229",
abstract="Today, a central and critical aspect of cybersecurity problems is related to software problem. Software security is about the understanding of software-induced security risks and how to manage them. To manage software security effectively, we need to understand the process of designing, building, and testing software for security. The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process that is currently used to support software development does not address any security components until after the software is developed. From the perspective of software security, the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) is similar to the SDLC but includes security components in its phases. There have been many SSDLC models proposed that are primarily modified from preexisting SDLC models. A study was conducted to survey a selected group of SSDLC models and their effectiveness. The authors first identified four popular SSDLC models used in the IT industry and then analyzed their common characteristics to derive four sets of criteria for comparison. These criteria are Focus Areas of Application, Implementation of Model, Security Implementations and Enhancements, and Security Training and Staff. Overall, the comparison results demonstrate that the Rastogi and Jones model is considered to be an effective one for many IT projects, especially for Agile projects. However, it is worthy to mention that, because of the various types of IT projects, one specific model cannot be applied for use in all types of IT projects. For an IT project operated in Waterfall, the BSI Seven Touchpoints model can be an excellent alternative.",
