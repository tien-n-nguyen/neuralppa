%\subsection{Significance of This Proposed Project: NSF Merit Criteria}

\section{Intellectual Merits}

The results of this project will advance the state-of-the-art
knowledge and scientific foundations in both program analysis and
machine learning. They are transformative and directly help improve
software quality with novel program analysis-based software
engineering tools.

\noindent \underline{{\bf Advance the state-of-the-art knowledge and
    understanding}}. Neural program analysis infrastructure in Thrusts
1--3 will advance the body of knowledge and theoretical foundations
for machine learning and AI for code. Thrust 4 will also help advance the
practical tools in software security and engineering.

\noindent \underline{{\bf Scientific foundation, creative/original
    research}}. This project will provide a scientific
foundation (novel concepts, representations, algorithms, models,
and tools) (1) to enable the analysis on partial code, (2) to empower
the program analysis techniques on both (in)complete code,
and (3) to enable the applications of program analysis on incomplete
code such as vulnerability detection on code snippets, code
completion, etc.

\section{Broader Impacts}

\underline{{\bf (1) Transformative and benefits to society}}. Our
results will be transformative and directly benefit to our society.
They will lead to increasing developers' productivity, software
quality \& reliability.  Our validation involves students and
professionals, promoting teaching, training, and learning of both {\bf
  program analysis} and {\bf machine learning} techniques that
have wide impacts in industry and academic communities.

\noindent\underline{{\bf (2) Foster other related research
    activities}}. Our results will foster {\em research activities in
  related fields of {\bf machine learning} and {\bf software
    security}}. We will produce theoretical concepts and
techniques that are novel in deep learning, e.g., novel neural
networks to model and learn for code. The applications of our neural
program analysis in software engineering applications will advance
software security and reliability.

%The collected {\bf large scale bug\&fix corpus} will be useful for
%software quality and reliability research.
%Innovations in CRL could be used to {\bf advance other SE tasks}. We
%will also develop {\bf novel DL-based bug detect-fix} approaches.


\noindent\underline{{\bf (3) Education, dissemination, and broader participation}} (Section~\ref{edu}). The
research will enhance the infrastructure for teaching/research via
tools and data sets for use by students and practitioners, and for
enhancement by researchers. We will provide related learning
modules for educators as well. It will include outreach activities for
undergraduate students, underrepresented groups, minorities, and women
in science.
%contribute novel
%teaching modules to our curriculum.
%Details will be presented in Section~\ref{edu}
