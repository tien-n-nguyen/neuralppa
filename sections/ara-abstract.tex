\noindent {\bf \textit{Abstract}.} Code fragments from developer forums often migrate to applications due to the code reuse practice. Owing to the limitation of current program analysis (PA) tools of only being able to analyze complete code, analyzing the incomplete code fragments to early determine the presence of potential vulnerabilities is challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated lexical, syntactic, and semantic repetitiveness of source code in open-source projects. In this proposal, we seek to address these issues as follows: (a) create benchmark CFG/PDG datasets of varying maturity levels; (b) develop a neural network-based program dependence learning infrastructure to predict CFG/PDGs for both complete and partial code fragments; (c) utilize the predicted CFG/PDGs to establish a pipeline to predict vulnerabilities in incomplete code fragments.
