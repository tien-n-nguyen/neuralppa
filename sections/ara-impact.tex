%\section{Impact of \tool on Program Analysis -- Potential Applications}
\section{Potential Applications}
\tool broadly affects program analysis as follows: (a) \underline{enable} efficient \textit{impact analysis} during the integration of code snippets by identifying the potential consequences of the change; (b) \underline{enable} \textit{partial program slicing} which helps in identifying the degree of optimality of the code snippet and how it can be improved before integrating into the codebase, or for debugging to locate the source of errors in the code snippet more easily; (c) \underline{empower} dynamic analysis by identifying additional path conditions (neural constraints) for the SAT/SMT solvers which helps in exploring the right subset of the symbolic state space.
