\section{Technical Merits}

\noindent \underline{{\bf Advance the state-of-the-art knowledge and understanding}}. Our research will fundamentally advance state-of-the-art research with novel theoretical foundations and practical techniques in analyzing programs and building {\em program dependence graphs, and enable vulnerability detection for partial code}.

\noindent \underline{{\bf Scientific foundation and creative/original research elements}}. We develop a scientific foundation, novel methodologies, frameworks, models, and algorithmic solutions for neural partial program analysis. Our infrastructure empowers program analysis (PA) with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enable program analysis on incomplete code fragments.
