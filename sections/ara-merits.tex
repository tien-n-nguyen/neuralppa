\section{Technical Merits}

\noindent \underline{{\bf Advance the state-of-the-art knowledge and
    understanding}}. Our research will fundamentally advance
the state-of-the-art research with novel theoretical foundations and
practical techniques in analyzing and building {\em program dependence
  graphs and program analysis, and vulnerability detection for partial
  code}.

\noindent \underline{{\bf Scientific foundation and creative/original
    research elements}}. We develop a scientific foundation, novel
methodologies, frameworks, models, and algorithmic solutions for
neural partial program analysis. Our infrastructure enpowers program
  analysis (PA) with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial
  intelligence (AI) to enable the program analysis on incomplete code
  fragments.
