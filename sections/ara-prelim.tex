%Toward this theme, in our preliminary work, we developed DeepPDA, a neural network-based partial program dependence analysis approach that learns to derive the program dependencies for any code fragments (i.e., both complete and incomplete). In our preliminary empirical evaluation, we intrinsically evaluated it on Java and C/C++ programs. First, we trained {\tool} on complete code. For testing, we treated each method individually and chose a consecutive portion within the method to predict the program dependencies, and compared them against the actual dependencies. Overall, DeepPDA predicts CFG and PDG edges in Java with an F-score of 94.29\%, and in C++ with an F-score of 92.46\%.

%We also developed as an approach to derive the data types of the variables in the code snippets. We treat the problem as statistical machine translation from source code with partially qualified names to source code with FQNs of the APIs. Our empirical evaluation on real-world code and StackOverflow posts shows that our technique achieves high accuracy with 97.6\% precision and 96.7\% recall in deriving data types in code snippets.
